# Postmortem: Server Error with Status Code 500 - November 9, 2023

## Overview

On November 9, 2023, our server encountered an error, returning a status code of 500. The log files did not provide useful information to identify the root cause of the issue. This postmortem aims to document the problem, its resolution, and preventive measures to avoid similar incidents in the future.

## Timeline

* Incident Detected: November 9, 2023, at 00:36 AM (GMT+2)
* Incident Resolution: November 9, 2023, a couple of hours later at 4:45 AM (GMT+2)

## Root Cause

The root cause of the server error was identified as a typo in the /var/www/html/wp-settings.php file. Specifically, a line contained the string 'phpp' instead of 'php'. This typo caused the server to malfunction and return a status code of 500.

## Resolution

To troubleshoot the issue, the following steps were taken:

1. Utilized tmux to open two terminals side by side for simultaneous testing and debugging.
2. In one terminal, used the curl command to send requests to the server.
3. In the other terminal, employed strace to trace system calls and analyze the server's behavior.

By analyzing the strace output, the typo in the wp-settings.php file was discovered. The line containing 'phpp' was corrected to 'php'. After applying this fix, the server started functioning correctly, and the status code 500 error was resolved.

## Preventive Measures

To prevent similar incidents in the future, the following measures have been implemented:

* Regular code reviews: Introducing a code review process to catch potential typos and other errors before deployment.
* Automated testing: Implementing automated tests to verify the integrity of critical files and configurations.

## Lessons Learned

This incident highlighted the importance of thorough testing and attention to detail. It also emphasized the value of using tools like tmux, curl, and strace for efficient debugging. By documenting and sharing this postmortem, we aim to improve our processes and prevent similar incidents in the future.
